##Social Network API
I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I used JavaScript date library to format timestamps.
